/**
 * SWIFT ARCHIVE — deployed-content check.
 *
 * Confirms that what GitHub Pages is actually serving matches what is in the
 * repository. Run on a schedule, half an hour behind the data updater.
 *
 * This exists because of a real failure: a Pages deploy timed out in its
 * "updating_pages" phase and aborted, and the site simply went on serving the
 * previous build. Nothing was down, nothing 404'd, no workflow of ours failed
 * — the site was just quietly four hours stale, and the only signal was an
 * email about a workflow nobody owns. A stalled deploy should be loud.
 *
 * Compares a sha256 of each tracked file against the same file fetched live.
 * Any mismatch fails the job, which is what sends the notification.
 *
 *   node verify-deploy.js
